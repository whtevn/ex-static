constants:
  SITE_HOME='~/Sites/static'
  BLUEPRINT_HOME='~/static'
  TEMPLATE_HOME='~/static/templates'
  
commands:
	start [(key)_name] [site | collection]
		start defaults to the site key if there is no active_site
		otherwise it defaults to a new collection

	edit [page_name | entry_title ] [ contents | [site_map | properties]
    page_name is unnecessary if there is an active page
    full page name is unnecessary. does a simple regex for pages
    and is case insensitive.
    if more than one page is available a yaml representation of the
    possibilities will be displayed to choose from. 

  add [name | title] [ page | entry ] [under page_name], (--edit, -e [content/display | false])
    adds a new page or entry of the title specified.
    if adding a page, you may use the under option to add
    the page under a specific page. page_name search is dealt with as elsewhere.
    edit is true by default under entries, but false for pages. 
    if using pages, you must indicate to the edit option whether you want to 
    mess with the display or copy of the page
  
	use [(key)_name] [ collection | page ]
    sets an active page or collection
    if no name is given a list of the chosen key is given.
    e.g. pages = [home, info] 
         -> view pages
            - home
            - info
            please choose a page: 
    type a page name (as in edit) to use

  show [(key)_name] [ recent | unpublished | all ] [ pages | contents ] [(--reset, -r)]
    defaults to collection [contents] if there is an active one
    otherwise defaults to the page 
    if there is an active page it will be used if no page_name is provided
    if there is an active page but there is a page_name provided
    the active page will not be reset unless the reset flag is tripped

	build [(key)_name] [site | page | collection]
	generate
  publish
  status [site | collection]
		this one seems complicated. and those keys arent right.
		options aren't
